        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This project was made to enhance the gameplay experience of OnePageRules's Age of Fantasy.
            But feel free to play with any system you see fit.
            <br><br>
            As this is a personal-side project. No intensive balancing were being made, and will be
            edited if I deemed it to be necessary, or it was clearly overpowered, or being
            requested by multiple individuals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>License stuff</h2>
